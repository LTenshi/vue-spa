    <h1>Home</h1>
    <p>I mostly made this <i>exact</i> page to show that I get how SPAs usually work via the use of things like vue-router :)</p>
    <p>The spec didn't mention the use of any ui frameworks, but also didn't prohibit them. However I decided against the use of them as I think it would have made this a bit too easy.</p>
    <p>I have also opted to not use vue-router for the purposes of this as the component is too small to warrant that. But if the page was larger and had to juggle more data I wouldn't hesitate.</p>
